# Homelab Evolution Roadmap
*A staged approach to building a production-grade homelab with Kubernetes*

## Current State: Foundation Services
**Hardware**: Main server (32GB RAM, 4 cores) + NAS storage
**Status**: Basic infrastructure partially deployed

---

## Stage 1: Stabilize Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Get reliable foundation services running

### Critical Tasks
1. **Fix infrastructure issues**
   - Resolve shared-infra YAML syntax error
   - Configure Cloudflare API tokens for Traefik
   - Test PostgreSQL and Redis connectivity

2. **Security & Access**
   - Implement backup strategy for databases
   - Set up SSL certificate automation
   - Deploy WireGuard VPN for remote access

3. **Monitoring Foundation**
   - Basic health checks and logging
   - Simple monitoring dashboard

**Success Criteria**: All core services healthy, secure remote access, automated backups

---

## Stage 2: Essential Applications (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Deploy primary productivity and media services

### Applications
- **Nextcloud**: File sync and collaboration
- **Immich**: Photo management (basic setup, no ML initially)
- **Home Assistant**: Smart home hub (on main server for now)
- **Basic media stack**: Plex + 1-2 *arr services

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Refined monitoring with Grafana
- Log aggregation setup
- Service health checks and dependencies

**Success Criteria**: Daily-use applications working reliably, comprehensive monitoring

---

## Stage 3: Hardware Expansion (Month 2)
**Goal**: Add distributed compute nodes

### Hardware Acquisition
- **Raspberry Pi 4/5**: IoT and always-on services (~$150)
- **Mini PC** (Intel N100/AMD): Compute-intensive tasks (~$200-300)

### Service Migration
- Move Home Assistant to Raspberry Pi
- Deploy emulation services on Mini PC
- Distribute workloads to optimize main server

### Network Improvements
- VLAN setup for IoT devices
- Inter-node communication optimization

**Success Criteria**: Distributed services running, main server CPU load reduced

---

## Stage 4: Kubernetes Migration (Month 3-4)
**Goal**: Migrate to K3s for enterprise-grade orchestration

### Phase 4a: Single Node K3s
1. **Setup K3s on main server**
   - Install K3s with Traefik ingress
   - Convert 2-3 simple services to Kubernetes manifests
   - Test persistent volumes with NFS storage

2. **Learn Kubernetes Fundamentals**
   - Deployments, Services, Ingresses
   - ConfigMaps and Secrets
   - Persistent Volume Claims

### Phase 4b: Multi-Node Cluster
1. **Add worker nodes**
   - Join Pi and Mini PC to cluster
   - Configure node selectors and taints
   - Implement pod scheduling rules

2. **Advanced Kubernetes Features**
   - Resource limits and requests
   - Health checks (liveness/readiness probes)
   - Rolling updates and rollbacks

### Phase 4c: GitOps Implementation
1. **Setup GitOps workflow**
   - Deploy ArgoCD or Flux
   - Move all configs to Git
   - Implement automated deployments

2. **Production Practices**
   - Namespace organization
   - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
   - Network policies for security

**Success Criteria**: Full homelab running on Kubernetes with GitOps automation

---

## Stage 5: Advanced Features (Month 5-6)
**Goal**: Enterprise-grade features and optimization

### Advanced Applications
- **ML-enabled Immich**: Photo AI on dedicated hardware
- **Gaming services**: Full emulation suite with streaming
- **Advanced Home Assistant**: Custom automations and integrations

### Infrastructure Maturity
- **Service mesh**: Istio or Linkerd for advanced networking
- **Advanced monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, alerting
- **Disaster recovery**: Multi-site backup and restore procedures
- **Security hardening**: Network policies, pod security standards

### Automation & CI/CD
- **Automated testing**: Service health validation
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- **Advanced GitOps**: Multi-environment deployments (dev/staging/prod)

**Success Criteria**: Production-grade homelab with enterprise patterns

---

## Stage 6: Scaling & Specialization (Ongoing)
**Goal**: Optimize and expand based on usage patterns

### Potential Additions
- **Additional compute nodes** for specific workloads
- **GPU acceleration** for AI/ML workloads
- **Edge computing** nodes for IoT processing
- **Dedicated storage nodes** for high-performance workloads

### Advanced Patterns
- **Multi-cluster management** (development vs production)
- **Service mesh federation** across clusters
- **Advanced observability** with distributed tracing
- **Cost optimization** with resource scheduling

---

## Migration Strategy Notes

### Docker Compose â†’ Kubernetes
- Keep Docker Compose files as reference
- Use tools like Kompose for initial conversion
- Gradually migrate services (start with stateless apps)
- Maintain rollback capability

### Risk Mitigation
- Always maintain working backups
- Test migrations in development environment first
- Keep documentation updated throughout process
- Implement monitoring before making changes

### Learning Resources
- **Kubernetes official docs** for fundamentals
- **K3s documentation** for homelab-specific setup
- **ArgoCD tutorials** for GitOps workflows
- **Prometheus/Grafana guides** for monitoring

---

## Timeline Summary
- **Month 1**: Stable foundation + essential apps
- **Month 2**: Hardware expansion + service distribution  
- **Month 3-4**: Kubernetes migration + GitOps
- **Month 5-6**: Advanced features + enterprise patterns
- **Ongoing**: Scaling + optimization based on needs

This roadmap balances learning Kubernetes (valuable for work) with practical homelab functionality, ensuring each stage provides immediate value while building toward a sophisticated final architecture.
